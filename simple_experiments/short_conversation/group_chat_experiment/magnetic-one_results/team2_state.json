Answer briefly.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request asks: \"What poem you mentioned before? Answer briefly.\" No poem title or details are provided in this message.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Check prior conversation history for any poem that may have been mentioned.\n- If no history is available here, ask the user to specify which poem they mean or provide the previous context.\n- Locations to search: this chat transcript, any stored memory of earlier interactions, or user-provided notes.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- No derivable facts without identifying the poem first.\n\n4.
