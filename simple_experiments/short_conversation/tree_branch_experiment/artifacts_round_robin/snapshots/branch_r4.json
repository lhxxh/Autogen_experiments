To identify the bird species from the BBC Earth clip, pick one option:\n\n- 1) Share the exact YouTube link plus the timestamp where the bird appears, and I\u2019ll identify the species from that moment.\n- 2) Describe the moment in as much detail as possible: colors, size, beak shape, any crest or distinctive markings, what the bird is doing, and roughly where in the scene (on water, in trees, on the ground).\n- 3) Paste the video description or captions (the list of clips and the animals involved) and I\u2019ll pinpoint the species from those descriptions.\n- 4) I can fetch the BBC Earth page myself and pull the details from the description/captions\u2014just say the word and I\u2019ll start. If you want, provide the clip title or a link and I\u2019ll begin.\n\nWhich option would you prefer? If you\u2019d like, you can start with option 2 and describe the moment now.",
