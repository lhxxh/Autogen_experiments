I\u2019ll identify the species and return a structured note you can save in a shared document.\n- Option 2: You provide a detailed description of the moment (colors, size, beak shape, distinctive markings, what the bird is doing, and approximate location in the scene). I\u2019ll identify the species and explain the reasoning.\n- Option 3: You paste the video description or captions (the list of clips and animals). I\u2019ll pinpoint the bird species from those descriptions.\n- Option 4: I fetch the BBC Earth page myself and pull details from the description/captions.
