We are working to address the following user request:

What is the weather in Seattle?


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.


Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  
   - The location mentioned is Seattle.  

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  
   - Current weather conditions in Seattle, which can typically be found on weather websites such as the National Weather Service, Weather.com, or local news stations.  

3. FACTS TO DERIVE  
   - None specific, as current weather information does not require logical deduction or computation, just retrieval of existing data.  

4. EDUCATED GUESSES  
   - In general, Seattle is known for its mild and rainy climate, so one might guess that it is overcast or rainy. However, this is not a specific fact pertaining to the date of the inquiry.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

- **Task Assignment to WebSurfer**:  
  - Instruct WebSurfer to search for and retrieve the current weather conditions in Seattle.  
  - Ask them to check reliable weather websites or local news outlets to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.  
  - Request a summary of the findings, including temperature, sky conditions, and any significant weather alerts if applicable.  
   
- **Review**:  
  - Once WebSurfer has provided the information, review the results to ensure clarity and accuracy before presenting the final weather update.
